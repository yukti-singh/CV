If you're a couple and just want to get a 3-4 minute dance performance prepared with the help of our expert wedding choreographers, call us.<br>
If you want a BIG INDIAN FAMILY DANCE, create a list of all family members – cousins, uncles, aunties, grand parents etc who will be coming to the event – you will need this list for invitations anyway, someone may have already made it.<br>
Put a tick against every person's name whose dancing on your event would make you really happy.<br>
Call those people and ask if they'd be willing to dance. Do tell them that it is a time commitment and that they will need to spare a minimum of 5 hours on 5 different days to be able to participate.<br>
Some people are shy, don't force them, but once we begin practice, invite them to watch a session. Some people think it's very hard and say no at first but then join in when they see others performing.<br>
Once your final list is complete, give us a call as we will ask you how many people are participating in the family choreography.<br>
You can also make a list of your favourite songs and try to think of the groups of people and which songs they'll be dancing to. Once we meet, we'll give you some ideas on songs, but it's good to have thought about it once before we meet.<br>
Couple ChoreographyWedding/Marrige dance for couples<br>
At Delhi Dance Academy we have helped various families perfect their wedding dance. With a growing number of couples performing dance routines at their own weddings, relatives performing family dances and even grand parents pitching in, good wedding choreographers in Delhi can help you create fond memories for decades to come. Here's an example of what amazing wedding choreography can do for your or your friend's/family member's wedding. The following short video shows a family rehearsing at their farm house and then performing at the event.<br><br>


At Delhi Dance Academy, we know what it takes to make your wedding day special and our Delhi based choreographers offer private lessons to help you perfect moves for your favourite wedding song. From the feedback we get from our clients we know that it means the world to the wedded couple when their loved ones perform a dance routine. You create memories to last a lifetime and what's more, you can even hire our professional dancers to dance alongside you or in the background just like you see in the movies. So if you want to make that event unforgettable, give us a call today!
<br><br>

If you want to make a friend's wedding special, you can get a few friends to dance together to make the occasion special. Our dance teachers can train groups and personalise dance moves on your favorite Hindi or English songs. We have trained various families to perform dance numbers at weddings - from 4 people to 50 people groups. With such groups, the challenge is that some people are good dancers and some are not, in which case the dance troupe is divided into people who can and cannot perform difficult dance moves. Our instructors are very well trained to divide the choreography in a way that everyone can participate.
<br><br>

<font color="crimson"><b>Couples:</b></font> We can help you prepare a 3-4 minute couple dance for Rs 6000 - Rs 10,000 (where we will invite you to our studio 4-6 times with the following breakup - first session 2 hours, second session 2 hours followed by various 1 hour sessions). If you prefer a choreographer to visit your place then the same package will cost you between Rs 10,200 and Rs 17,000 (for Delhi + NCR locations only).
<br>
<font color="crimson"><b>Family Packages:</b></font> Family packages are very time and number of people dependent. Please call us to discuss your requirements and we'll be happy to quote.
<br>
<font color="crimson"><b>Solo Performances:</b></font> Rs 4,000 to Rs 6,000 if you come to our studio or Rs 6,800 to Rs 10,200 if we come to you.
<br>
Prices for lighting, DJs, Anchors, Music Bands, Scripts, Concept etc. on demand.
<br>
We have a fair-price system where you will not pay depending on your budget - we don't overcharge or change pricing for different people. We therefore are not able to do any discounts either. We are one of the most reasonably priced wedding choreography institutes and still have the highest earning choreographers, because of which we deliver higher quality than most other service providers.<br></font></i></p>
